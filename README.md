# Multilingual Story Generation with Planning project

### Downloading relevant stories

To load the relevant stories for every language, run the `process_data` script as follows, e.g.:

```
bash process_data de
```

This will create `global-asp/<language_code>` directory containing only the relevant gold stories in the language `language_code`.
